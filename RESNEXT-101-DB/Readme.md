# How to run the code

### Steps

```
# 1. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/SPECTOGRAM_Generation___Paths.ipynb | this will generate spectogram dataset & Paths
# 2. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_0.ipynb
# 3. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_5.ipynb  
# 4. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_9.ipynb
# 5. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_1_2.ipynb
# 6. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_3_4.ipynb
# 7. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_9.ipynb
# 8. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_6.ipynb
# 9. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/FOLD_7_8.ipynb
# 10. run GIZ-COMPETITION/RESNEXT-101-DB/INFERENCE.ipynb
```

### Expectations
```
To make sure that everything is working smoothly, here is what to expect from above (steps):

# Please pay attention to the GPU used in every notebook  with the command : !nvidia-smi
