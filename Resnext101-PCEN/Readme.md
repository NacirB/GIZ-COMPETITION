# How to run the code

### Steps

```
# 1. run GIZ-COMPETITION/Resnext101-PCEN/PCEN_SPECTOGRAM_Generation___Paths.ipynb | this will generate PCEN spectogram dataset & Paths
# 2. run GIZ-COMPETITION/Resnext101-PCEN/FOLD_0_1_2_3_4_5.ipynb
# 3. run GIZ-COMPETITION/Resnext101-PCEN/FOLD_6_7_8_9.ipynb  

Then you'll get 10 fold model weights in the folder created in  PCEN_SPECTOGRAM_Generation___Paths.ipynb  | "/content/drive/MyDrive/Giz_NLP_AUDIO/Resnext101_PCEN"
# 10. run GIZ-COMPETITION/Resnext101-PCEN/INFERENCE.ipynb
```

### Expectations
```
To make sure that everything is working smoothly, here is what to expect from above (steps):

# Please pay attention to the GPU used in every notebook  with the command : !nvidia-smi

```
